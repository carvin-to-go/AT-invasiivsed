# AT_invasiivsed
Project B4: EFFECTS OF INVASIVE SPECIES 

Team:  Reelika Pärnpuu, Marta Miia Pärnpuu

Goals: 
1. The general goal is to prevent the spread of invasive species, mostly by analysing
and implementing new invasive species control methods. We will be working on data from
before the control methods have been implemented, but the project will go on to analyse the
same areas after implementation. 
2. A narrower goal would be to find ways for the plant to utilise Python in biology-related data mining, since biology work groups (at least in Tartu University) usually use R instead. To test how well Python can be utilized for biology-related data, we set the goal to look for general correlations in datasets provided for us.

This work can be recreated by following the code in DS_main.


Guide:

* Jupyter Notebook: "DS_main"

* Dataset 1: "EEB_samples.xlsx", there are a total of 216 samples. The samples have been taken from 24 locations; in each location the quadrat method has been used to collect data from 3 sub-sample areas. For each quadrat, the sample was taken 3 times. We'll use this dataframe 
mostly for 3 categorical values “invaded”, “transitional” and “natural”.

* Dataset 2: “EEB_soil_chemistry.xlsx”, soil analysis, we will be using most of this dataset.

* Dataset 3: “Plant_survey_2023_final.xlsx”, sample ID codes and the counts of different plant species in the sample area.

* Dataset 4: "YSI_matrix.xlsx", "newness" of a species, data for calculating the Biotic Novelty Index.
